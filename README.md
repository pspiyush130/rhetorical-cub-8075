# Getting Started

Amazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos, who chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent, as Microsoft was in the area.

This project might ( and certainly does ) have bugs, vulnerabilities or some other types of issues. So, contributions are always welcome â˜º
